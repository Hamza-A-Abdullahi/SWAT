# Space Wars & Tactics - SWAT

“Space Wars and Tactics” (SWAT) is a strategy game. The current prototype provides a very simplified version of the game for one player. In the future, this game will allow a player/s to play against each other and will have a more complex set of fights and forces, as well as introducing random elements.
You have at your disposal 1000 bit coins in your war chest. As the admiral, you must  assemble your fighting fleet by selecting (activating) some of the forces in the Allied Space Fleet. However, activating a force will cost you an activation fee. You will then be expected to undertake some fights. Winning a fight will bring you gains and increase your war chest. Losing a fight will cost you and decrease your war chest. In addition, if a force is defeated in a fight, it is destroyed and cannot be used again.
